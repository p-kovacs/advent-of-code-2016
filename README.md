# Advent of Code 2016

Solutions for the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016), written in Java.

The general utilities and algorithms used in the solutions are also available in a separate repository: https://github.com/p-kovacs/java-utils.

## How to use

Execute `./gradlew run -Pday=<number>` to run the solution for the given day. For example, `./gradlew run -Pday=3`.

Java 17 (or newer) is required to be specified in `JAVA_HOME`.

## Input files

For each day, the corresponding input files in `src/main/resources` contain my personal input data.
You can replace them with your own ones.
